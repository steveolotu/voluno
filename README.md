I basically started to learn complex coding while working on this project. I worked on it for about 3 years. It never got completed, but I learned a lot while working on it.

The sole purpose of this repository is to showcase my code to potential employers. However, since it was my first project, my coding skills have massively improved since then and I would not recommend to anyone to actually use my code.

The poject is structured as follows:
- a WordPress website is the base
- apart fro minor changes, settings and pieces of code, the most code is stored in a single, external folder. This folder is the one which I've uploaded to this repository.
