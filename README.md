# voluno

This is my own “Sandbox” project. It’s my first serious project ever, I was the client myself and I basically only worked on it because I couldn’t afford a professional web developer. Hence, I was a complete amateur when I began work. When I had run out of funding and stopped working on it 3 years later, it still wasn’t complete, but I had become a full-blown web developer and decided to continue building websites professionally.

The website is integrated into WordPress but uses a lot of custom features. Generally, due to my low level of knowledge at the time, I custom built a lot of features which could have easily been integrated with plugins or by other means. This cost me a lot of time, but also thought me a lot about web development, big projects and creative solutions to complex problems.

The sole purpose of this repository is to showcase my code to potential employers. However, since it was my first project, my coding skills have massively improved since then and I would not recommend to anyone to actually use my code. This repository consists of the main folder of the project, where most of the code was stored.

The website contains several highly complex and interlinked components, most of which largely consist of costum code. Some were complete and ready, others only half done:

- Official website to present the organization
- Intranet
- Social network
- Forum system
- Simple CMS and an intranet for development organizations
- Platform for the different Voluno services and roles (tasks, trainings, advice, internships and agency)
- Newsletter and notification system
- Rating system
- Knowledge database
- Calendar
- Documentation wiki
- etc.
